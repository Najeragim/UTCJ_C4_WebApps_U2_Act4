    <h1>History of the HTML Language</h1>
    <h2 id="html_2.0">HTML 2.0 (1995)</h2>
    <p>
        "The HTML 2.0 standard is published. Despite its name, HTML 2.0 is the first official 
        HTML standard. The structure of the document was simplified as much as possible 
        to speed up editing, where the explicit declaration of the body, html and head 
        elements is optional." (Pirajan, 2022) <br>
        “HTML 2.0 introduced the general structure that has been retained in later versions 
        of HTML. An overarching HTML element contains a HEAD element and a 
        BODY element, defining the two main components of an HTML document. The 
        BODY component contains the visible content of document. The HEAD 
        component contains the mandatory TITLE element and optional elements for 
        document metadata, links to related external resources, and support for server 
        functions. The new META element was introduced as an extensible container for 
        individual metadata elements, expressed as name/value pairs. Another new feature 
        standardized in HTML 2.0 was support for forms that allow users to enter and submit 
        data, triggering an action, such as a search.” (Murray, Nappier, & Holdzkom, 2018)
    </p>
    <h2 id="html_3.2">HTML 3.2 (1997)</h2>
    <p>
        “HTML 3.2 introduces a new element: FIG for inline figures, includes support for 
        equations and formulas, horizontal tabs and horizontal alignment of headers and 
        paragraph text, the LINK element can be used to provide standard toolbar/menu 
        items for navigation, such as previous and next buttons, forms have been extended 
        to support graphical selection menus, is designed to be used together with style 
        sheets” (Connolly, 1995) <br>
        • “With version 3.2 of HTML, HTML tags were further improved. It is worth noting 
        that because of W3C standard maintenance, the newer version of HTML was 3.2 
        instead of 3. <br>
        • Now, HTML 3.2 has better support for new form elements. Another important 
        feature what HTML 3.2 implemented was support for CSS. CSS stands for 
        Cascading Style Sheet. It is CSS that provides features to make HTML tags look 
        better on rendering it on browsers. CSS helps to style HTML elements. <br>
        • With the upgradation of browsers to HTML 3.2, the browser also supported for 
        frame tags, although HTML specifications still do not support frame markup tags.”
        (Pedamkar, 2022)

    <h2 id="html_4.0">HTML 4.0 (1997)</h2>
    <p>
        “HTML 4 encourages separating a document's structure from its presentation, new 
        attributes on the TABLE, TH, and TD elements allow table summaries and a more 
        explicit association between a cell and its header information, the new FIELDSET 
        element allows form controls to be grouped together and the LEGEND element 
        provides a caption for the group, the new LABEL element associates a text label with 
        a form control, HTML 4 adopts the Universal Character Set as its character set, The 
        new ID, CLASS, and STYLE attributes allow style information to be attached to 
        specific elements, The SCRIPT element now includes attributes for specifying the 
        scripting language […]” (Quinn, 1998)

    <h2 id="html_4.01">HTML 4.01 (1999)</h2>
    <p>
        “Since the publication of HTML 4.01, the W3C focused on the development of the 
        XHTML standard. For this reason, in 2004, the companies Apple, Mozilla and Opera 
        expressed their concern about the lack of interest of the W3C in HTML and decided 
        to organize themselves into a new association called WHATWG (Web Hypertext 
        Application Technology Working Group) that began the development of the HTML 
        5.” (Pirajan, 2022)

    <h2 id="html_4.01_strict">HTML 4.01 Strict (2000)</h2>
    <p>
        “In this type of document, we can use HTML 4.01 tags, but obsolete tags are not 
        accepted, that is, tags from older versions. It is the version that if we use in theory 
        should give us an optimal result in the most modern browsers, but this was not the 
        case forever.” (Pirajan, 2022)
    </p>
    <h2 id="html_4.01_transitional">HTML 4.01 Transitional (2001)</h2>
    <p>
        "All tags from all versions of HTML can be used in this type of document. Using this 
        variant of HTML raises the question of whether it's okay to allow the use of 
        deprecated tags that might stop working in future versions of browsers." (Pirajan, 
        2022)

    <h2 id="html_4.01_frametest">HTML 4.01 Frametest (2002)</h2>
    <p>
        "This type of document has support for frames. Frames are frames as small sub-windows within the same web page that were used a lot a few years ago but 
        nowadays are used less and less."

    <h2 id="html_5.0">HTML 5.0 (2014)</h2>
    <p>
        • “New Semantic Elements - These are like HEADER, FOOTER, and SECTION.
            • Forms 2.0 - Improvements to HTML web forms where new attributes have been 
            introduced for INPUT tag. <br>
            • Persistent Local Storage - To achieve without resorting to third-party plugins. <br>
            • WebSocket - A next-generation bidirectional communication technology for web 
            applications. <br>
            • Server-Sent Events - HTML5 introduces events which flow from web server to 
            the web browsers and they are called Server-Sent Events (SSE). <br>
            • Canvas - This supports a two-dimensional drawing surface that you can program 
            with JavaScript. <br>
            • Audio & Video - You can embed audio or video on your webpages without 
            resorting to third-party plugins. <br>
            • Geolocation - Now visitors can choose to share their physical location with your 
            web application. <br>
            • Microdata - This lets you create your own vocabularies beyond HTML5 and 
            extend your web pages with custom semantics. <br>
            • Drag and drop - Drag and drop the items from one location to another location 
            on the same webpage.” (Tutorials Point, 2022)
